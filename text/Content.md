### Empowering South Sudanese Youth in Leadership & Training

---

## #ASKnet - Sharing Skills and Knowledge  
#ASKnet is a peer to peer community network that aims to raise media literacy and increase access to information for young innovators in and from South Sudan, Uganda and Kenya. Creating a network of trainers, the #ASKnet community hubs are working together to share their skills and experience. In 2018 #ASKnet workshop participants included local Rhino Camp community members, joined by prospective trainers from Bidibidi refugee settlement (Yumbe district), Adjumani district, the Kiryandongo refugee settlement (Bweyale) as well as South Sudan and Kenya. 
   
## #ASKnet Open Training Guide 
This Open Training Guide (#OTG) is a learning resource that can be used by anyone to facilitate easier Access to Skills and Knowledge. It offers tools and methodologies to help design and run your own training, wherever you may be, with whatever resources you have at hand.  

The #OTG was developed in conjunction with the #ASKnet ToT training programme 2018, hosted by CTEN, the Community Technology Empowerment Network, at their Refugee Information Center (RIC) in Rhino Camp refugee settlement (Arua District, Uganda), in collaboration with Hive Colab (Kampala, Uganda) and funded by the ‘Access to Information and Supporting Freedom of Expression’ programme of the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ).


CTEN Uganda aims to strengthen media literacy, basic IT, access to open information as well as community training methods and workshop development skills in Rhino Camp and beyond.

# What is Open Training?


## How do I give training if I don’t have those skills and I want to share information?

**Equipping people with tools and methodologies to be able to transfer knowledge effectively. The open training philosophy enables participants to become trainers themselves.**

## FREE as in Freedom
## Open knowledge and Open Source 
  *  Content is developed by users themselves (user centred)
*   Content is developed as the learning goes on - something new is discovered.
*  Content built on available content - REMIX / RENEW knowledge and information
*  Varies from place to place - changes depending on where you are. 

## OPEN TRAINING GUIDE
**The Open Training Guide offers an introduction on how to create and deliver your own training. Everyone is encouraged to create content based on your own skills and knowledge!**

The Open Training Guide offers participants knowledge on who a trainer is, what is expected of a trainer, how to create a training, selecting a target group, how to search for content on open source repositories online and everything about online media. Open training includes logistics & technical skills, various training formats & documentation, communications channel teamwork and output to create a Team of skilled #OpenTrainers.

“I learnt a lot from the ToT training and have started using the knowledge I gained to facilitate community dialogue in my community in Adjumani. I gained skills, vital for some of us who do not have a good education, and got small employment with NGOs to do trainings like hygiene promotion; and learned to search for open source information online.” **James Asaliza**
# METHODOLOGIES
**Presented in a P2P (Peer to Peer) learning format to support the development of open training & research skills through an INTERACTIVE and constantly adapting  process.**

Participants are introduced to skills on how to create their own content. Trainers do not provide notes to the participants during training, but rather encourage them to create their own content of the training based on how they understand the topics and interpret them.  

This results in the creation of an open document where the participants and trainers enter ideas, notes and information related to the training on a daily basis. Participants become comfortable creating content for their own trainings.

“The training was very insightful. I will be conducting future training on how to make water filters for my community … Having a platform to pitch diverse ideas was totally amazing … the organisations I interacted with have proven to take an interest in what we are doing.” Participant **Hellen Kimaru**
# FORMATS
## Research various formats, try them out to decide what works best for your training!

**Training formats include: lectures and presentations, role play, brainstorming, group discussion, unconference, interviews, fireside chat, storytelling and P2P improvisation.**
### EXAMPLES
**World Café**
Discussion questions using hate speech example:
What are the cases of hate speech you’ve heard?
Why do you think the people use this speech?
How can this speech be reduced?
Fake News Discussion
Hate Speech mitigation: #defyhatenow

**Kudos Jar**
Feedback sessions can be conducted as part of each training day or week with a “Kudos Jar.” Trainers and participants have an informal get-together, sitting around a campfire maybe, where notes with positive comments to trainers or participants are read and passed around. During the training period anyone can write anonymous notes and drop them in the “Kudos Jar.” This process gives confidence and encouragement to the participants and trainers to work even harder or improve on what they did during trainings.

**#ASKotec**
**Access to Skills and Knowledge open tech emergency kit**
The #ASKotec is a kit designed to work as a mobile trainer‘s set to tackle basic field challenges when it comes to community access to skills development, open and collaborative learning, upcycling and open hardware innovation, as well as repairing all kinds of everyday things. The kit is used to help deliver basic understanding of mechanical and electrical tools, ICT and electronics, and other forms of hands-on experience with technology. Building a LED light or a solar charger for mobile, fixing broken radios or accessing valuable online resources when you are offline … all are inside #ASKotec, as are an Open Learning Guide (#OLG), and Open Hardware Guide (#OHG) and this Open Training Guide (#OTG)! 

# SCENARIOS
## Social Media Literacy
**HOW TO INTRODUCE CONCEPTS OF SOCIAL MEDIA LITERACY**
‘Media’ is simply a way to carry a message from one person to another, using technology.
Media literacy is the ability to access, understand, analyse, evaluate and also create media.

“Social media is about community. In the past people meet and share. Schools have clubs, villages have groups, councils of elders, children, and more. These people are interrelated in one way or the other. Friends of friends, members of a group - the only difference is that they meet physically. In recent years social media has imitated the lifestyle of communities and made them into platforms online. These virtual communities help to share activities and lifestyles that are similar to a physical community, online.” #ASKnet ToT Discussion Excerpt

## Women & Girls Participation 
**HOW TO ENSURE WOMEN PARTICIPATE ACTIVELY IN A TRAINING** 
Take the elements that are especially important to consider for gender equality - to make sure you really do give space and time for women to actively participate and be confident. 

Actively creating safe spaces for women to express themselves, not only ‘for women’ but also men and boys - how to listen to women, give space to participate, not being bossy!

Invite more women to participate, encourage, overcome barriers (eg need childcare).

“Since the training I have started a ‘girls rescue Africa’ Initiative teaching women and girls about menstruation and pregnancy, meeting with women and girls in locations like Odobu in Rhino Camp.” **Clara Given**
## #OpenTech 
**HOW TO BUILD THINGS … 
A SOLAR CHARGER, A WATER FILTER & MORE!**
Concepts to introduce include: #OpenTech, upcycling, process documentation, basic electronics: soldering, circuits, understanding power supply and solar energy - and the concepts of open hardware and repair culture. Outcomes can be LED lights, building solar chargers, a communications dish for signal principles, charcoal water filters or developing handcraft skills. Setting up and maintaining a workshop, running a community  repair café for broken devices by engaging the community in repairing their broken devices (eg. radios, solar lights etc.) and helping people solve the issues with their electronics. 

How to  document your work to share with others: tutorial creation, workspace preparation, feedback loops, new ideation and teamwork, adapting your training towards a workflow. Also learning about Licences, access to free information and Open Source principles. 

“We are now training our communities on how to build water filters. Together with a team of other young ladies we are building water filters for sale to community members who can not do it themselves.” **Dawa Edina, Keji Esther & Sida Lilian**

# DOCUMENTATION 
## Be visible! Share your knowledge and experience!
Documentation is key to share and publish training resources as you create them.

Types of documentation:
Impressions | Social Media | Process | Steps | Tutorial

Consider taking notes, photos & video as a design feature of your training.

Document each of the steps and make examples to publish your tutorials.

Make your tutorials available in an open repository that anyone can easily access. This is how you can #BeTheChange in your community!

# ENCOURAGE WOMEN & GIRLS 
### GENDER EQUALITY & ACTIVE PARTICIPATION FOR ALL!
Considering gender equality needs to be actively embedded into the training.
Create safe spaces for women to meet, express challenges & listen to their needs.
Also meet with the men to encourage them to listen & give a chance to the ladies! 
Make space and time for women to actively participate and become more confident. 
Remember to support shy participants of any gender who are not so confident!

**Anyone** who wants to be a trainer or mentor, sharing their skills and experience should be encouraged to do so!

# WHERE TO START?
### Decide what is most important! 
**Needs assessment:** Identify the needs of participants and their communities.

**Invite participants** with relevant interests / experience to take part in the training.

**Decide on topic** search for similar content and tools on open source repositories online. You’ll find lots of material to help design your workshop!

Actively invite women to participate & overcome barriers to attending training. 

Create safe space for learning - what do you say/do in front of your trainees?	

# Co-create Rules for the Training:
### Ground rules [some examples … ] 
**Time Management = Respect = Active Participation**

Phones on silent! Everyone can participate in keeping the training space clean. 

**Invite participants** to take on roles eg. timekeeper or reminder of ground rules

Give **KUDOS** during training - set up a Kudo Box to collect notes of appreciation, then read and share them with the group after the training. 

*IMAGE:person with raised hand*

# WHO IS ON YOUR TEAM?
